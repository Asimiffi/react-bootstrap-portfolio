      desc: ["I have five years of management position experience and overall 8 year of versatile experience working in different organizations. Currently, I am working as a Project Manager at Finerts. As a side-hobby, I started creating websites, using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap in March 2021. Gradually, I developed interest in coding and realized that I should pursue this as a career. Initially, I created website homepages using HTML, CSS and Javascript, but with time I realized that I should design websites in React, because of its component segregation (cleaner code), single-page loading and fast response. Besides, I also make the use of Bootstrap to have cleaner CSS files.",
      "I remained persistent for over a year and kept creating small projects. To get to know the basics of full stack apps, I also built full-stack MERN hotel booking app using a tutorial, in which I learnt CRUD operations, then I created a very small inventory and blog creation websites (full-stack) on my own. I will be more than willing to learn full-stack development (MERN) with Next JS, if the organization wants me to do it. I have the ability to learn things on my own and there is every possibility that I could be serving the organization as a full-stack developer in the next 6 months.",
      " I also delivered three small web projects to the clients. Two of them were built in React and Bootstrap (refurbs.pk, laundracan.com). Third project was deployed using React and Tailwind CSS (finerts.com.pk). As a react developer I make the use of functional components (React hooks) but I will be flexible to use class based components as well. I am well versed with the concepts of React lifecycle methods, state management tools like Redux and Restful APIs. So, my experience working as an independent developer to pursue the passion of coding speaks volume of my abilities in this field."

I am seasoned working at managerial role: planning, organizing, leading and controlling.  During my job role, I managed several teams, organized and created tasks to align lower-level workforce goals with the strategic vision of the organization and led a team to achieve organizational goals. This experience can be quite useful in software field, where a software lead developer has to make plans to design new software and web applications, monitor progress throughout the design process and setting goals for the software development team.`,

I conceptualized the whole idea of this project to foster learning among Pakistani students through contests. During the product creation, I led a team of web developer, data collectors & uploaders and ensured smooth data uploading without duplication of content. I also employed quality control methods to maintain the quality of the content. Additionally, I made sure that the budget should stay within the limits of the mutual investors. This product development experience can well be exploited in big-software development projects too, which require several teams to work in coordination. `,
